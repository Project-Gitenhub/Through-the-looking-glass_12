version notes:

"Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There" is the sequel to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", and is likewise a humoristic nonsense story for children of all ages, written by Lewis Carroll (pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) and first published in 1871. In this book Alice meets the Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the White and Red Queens, Humpty Dumpty, and the White Knight. This version is illustrated with all the original 50 drawings by John Tenniel.

The text is proofread, and formatted with curly quotes and dashes. I wish I could have done the "inverted" Jabberwocky fragment with CSS, but had to use an image instead. I hope the initial chess problem and tables work fine too. There is some code for non-rectangular wrapping around pictures, but it's commented out, because I'm not entirely satisfied with how it works in all cases (e.g., in landscape orientation).

Also available the first story: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

Any kind of feedback is welcome.

EDIT (v2): Fixed a couple of indent issues
