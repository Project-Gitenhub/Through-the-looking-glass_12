<h1>Preface to the 1896 Edition</h1>

<p class="initial">As the chess-problem, given on the previous page, has puzzled
some of my readers, it may be well to explain that it is correctly worked out,
so far as the <em>moves</em> are concerned. The <em>alternation</em> of Red and
White is perhaps not so strictly observed as it might be, and the
&lsquo;castling&rsquo; of the three Queens is merely a way of saying that they
entered the palace; but the &lsquo;check&rsquo; of the White King at move 6, the
capture of the Red Knight at move 7, and the final &lsquo;checkmate&rsquo; of
the Red King, will be found, by any one who will take the trouble to set the
pieces and play the moves as directed, to be strictly in accordance with the
laws of the game.</p>

<p>The new words, in the poem &lsquo;<a
href="Chapter-01.xhtml#Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>&rsquo;, have given rise to
some difference of opinion as to their pronunciation: so it may be well to give
instructions on <em>that</em> point also. Pronounce &lsquo;slithy&rsquo; as if
it were the two words &lsquo;sly, the&rsquo;: make the &lsquo;g&rsquo;
<em>hard</em> in &lsquo;gyre&rsquo; and &lsquo;gimble&rsquo;: and pronounce
&lsquo;rath&rsquo; to rhyme with &lsquo;bath.&rsquo;</p>

<p>For this sixty-first thousand, fresh electrotypes have been taken from the
wood-blocks (which, never having been used for printing from, are in as good
condition as when first cut in 1871), and the whole book has been set up afresh
with new type. If the artistic qualities of this re-issue fall short, in any
particular, of those possessed by the original issue, it will not be for want of
painstaking on the part of author, publisher, or printer.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity of announcing that the Nursery &lsquo;Alice,&rsquo;
hitherto priced at four shillings, net, is now to be had on the same terms as
the ordinary shilling picture-books &ndash; although I feel sure that it is, in
every quality (except the <em>text</em> itself, in which I am not qualified to
pronounce), greatly superior to them. Four shillings was a perfectly reasonable
price to charge, considering the very heavy initial outlay I had incurred:
still, as the Public have practically said, &lsquo;We will <em>not</em> give
more than a shilling for a picture-book, however artistically got-up,&rsquo; I
am content to reckon my outlay on the book as so much dead loss, and, rather
than let the little ones, for whom it was written, go without it, I am selling
it at a price which is, to me, much the same thing as <em>giving</em> it
away.</p>
