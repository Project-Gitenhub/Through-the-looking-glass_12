<h1>Tweedledum and Tweedledee</h1>

<p class="initial"><span class="drop">T</span><span class="first">hey</span>
were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other&#8217;s neck, and
Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had
&lsquo;DUM&rsquo; embroidered on his collar, and the other &lsquo;DEE.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I suppose they&#8217;ve each got &ldquo;TWEEDLE&rdquo; round at the back
of the collar,&rsquo; she said to herself.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill19">
<img src="images/Illustration-19.jpg" alt="They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other&#8217;s neck" />
</div>

<p>They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just
looking round to see if the word &ldquo;TWEEDLE&rdquo; was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked
&lsquo;DUM.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you think we&#8217;re wax-works,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you ought
to pay, you know. Wax-works weren&#8217;t made to be looked at for nothing,
nohow!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Contrariwise,&rsquo; added the one marked &lsquo;DEE,&rsquo; &lsquo;if
you think we&#8217;re alive, you ought to speak.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m very sorry,&rsquo; was all Alice could say;
for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of
a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&lsquo;Tweedledum and Tweedledee</p>
<p class="indented">Agreed to have a battle;</p>
<p>For Tweedledum said Tweedledee</p>
<p class="indented">Had spoiled his nice new rattle.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Just then flew down a monstrous crow,</p>
<p class="indented">As black as a tar-barrel;</p>
<p>Which frightened both the heroes so,</p>
<p class="indented">They quite forgot their quarrel.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I know what you&#8217;re thinking about,&rsquo; said Tweedledum:
&lsquo;but it isn&#8217;t so, nohow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Contrariwise,&rsquo; continued Tweedledee, &lsquo;if it was so, it
might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn&#8217;t, it ain&#8217;t.
That&#8217;s logic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; Alice said very politely, &lsquo;which is the
best way out of this wood: it&#8217;s getting so dark. Would you tell me,
please?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.</p>

<p>They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice
couldn&#8217;t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying &lsquo;First
Boy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nohow!&rsquo; Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up
again with a snap.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Next Boy!&rsquo; said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt
quite certain he would only shout out &lsquo;Contrariwise!&rsquo; and so he
did.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;ve been wrong!&rsquo; cried Tweedledum. &lsquo;The first
thing in a visit is to say &ldquo;How d&#8217;ye do?&rdquo; and shake
hands!&rsquo; And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they
held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her.</p>

<p>Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of
hurting the other one&#8217;s feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were
dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards),
and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the
tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make
it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and
fiddle-sticks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it certainly <em>was</em> funny,&rsquo; (Alice said afterwards,
when she was telling her sister the history of all this), &lsquo;to find myself
singing &ldquo;Here we go round the mulberry bush.&rdquo; I don&#8217;t know
when I began it, but somehow I felt as if I&#8217;d been singing it a long long
time!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. &lsquo;Four
times round is enough for one dance,&rsquo; Tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.</p>

<p>Then they let go of Alice&#8217;s hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn&#8217;t know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. &lsquo;It would
never do to say &ldquo;How d&#8217;ye do?&rdquo; <em>now</em>,&rsquo; she said
to herself: &lsquo;we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope you&#8217;re not much tired?&rsquo; she said at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nohow. And thank you <em>very</em> much for asking,&rsquo; said
Tweedledum.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So <em>much</em> obliged!&rsquo; added Tweedledee. &lsquo;You like
poetry?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ye-es, pretty well &ndash; <em>some</em> poetry,&rsquo; Alice said
doubtfully. &lsquo;Would you tell me which road leads out of the
wood?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What shall I repeat to her?&rsquo; said Tweedledee, looking round at
Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The Walrus and the Carpenter&rdquo; is the longest,&rsquo;
Tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug.</p>

<p>Tweedledee began instantly:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<p>&lsquo;The sun was shining&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Here Alice ventured to interrupt him. &lsquo;If it&#8217;s <em>very</em>
long,&rsquo; she said, as politely as she could, &lsquo;would you please tell me
first which road&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&lsquo;The sun was shining on the sea,</p>
<p class="indented">Shining with all his might:</p>
<p>He did his very best to make</p>
<p class="indented">The billows smooth and bright&mdash;</p>
<p>And this was odd, because it was</p>
<p class="indented">The middle of the night.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The moon was shining sulkily,</p>
<p class="indented">Because she thought the sun</p>
<p>Had got no business to be there</p>
<p class="indented">After the day was done&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s very rude of him,&rdquo; she said,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;To come and spoil the fun!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The sea was wet as wet could be,</p>
<p class="indented">The sands were dry as dry.</p>
<p>You could not see a cloud, because</p>
<p class="indented">No cloud was in the sky:</p>
<p>No birds were flying over head&mdash;</p>
<p class="indented">There were no birds to fly.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>
<p class="indented">Were walking close at hand;</p>
<p>They wept like anything to see</p>
<p class="indented">Such quantities of sand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this were only cleared away,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indented">They said, &ldquo;it <em>would</em> be grand!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="illustration" id="ill20">
<img src="images/Illustration-20.jpg" alt="The Walrus and the Carpenter were walking close at hand" />
</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;If seven maids with seven mops</p>
<p class="indented">Swept it for half a year,</p>
<p>Do you suppose,&rdquo; the Walrus said,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;That they could get it clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said the Carpenter,</p>
<p class="indented">And shed a bitter tear.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;O Oysters, come and walk with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indented">The Walrus did beseech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,</p>
<p class="indented">Along the briny beach:</p>
<p>We cannot do with more than four,</p>
<p class="indented">To give a hand to each.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The eldest Oyster looked at him.</p>
<p class="indented">But never a word he said:</p>
<p>The eldest Oyster winked his eye,</p>
<p class="indented">And shook his heavy head&mdash;</p>
<p>Meaning to say he did not choose</p>
<p class="indented">To leave the oyster-bed.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But four young oysters hurried up,</p>
<p class="indented">All eager for the treat:</p>
<p>Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,</p>
<p class="indented">Their shoes were clean and neat&mdash;</p>
<p>And this was odd, because, you know,</p>
<p class="indented">They hadn&#8217;t any feet.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Four other Oysters followed them,</p>
<p class="indented">And yet another four;</p>
<p>And thick and fast they came at last,</p>
<p class="indented">And more, and more, and more&mdash;</p>
<p>All hopping through the frothy waves,</p>
<p class="indented">And scrambling to the shore.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The Walrus and the Carpenter</p>
<p class="indented">Walked on a mile or so,</p>
<p>And then they rested on a rock</p>
<p class="indented">Conveniently low:</p>
<p>And all the little Oysters stood</p>
<p class="indented">And waited in a row.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="illustration" id="ill21">
<img src="images/Illustration-21.jpg" alt="And all the little Oysters stood and waited in a row" />
</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;The time has come,&rdquo; the Walrus said,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;To talk of many things:</p>
<p>Of shoes &ndash; and ships &ndash; and sealing-wax&mdash;</p>
<p class="indented">Of cabbages &ndash; and kings&mdash;</p>
<p>And why the sea is boiling hot&mdash;</p>
<p class="indented">And whether pigs have wings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;But wait a bit,&rdquo; the Oysters cried,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;Before we have our chat;</p>
<p>For some of us are out of breath,</p>
<p class="indented">And all of us are fat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hurry!&rdquo; said the Carpenter.</p>
<p class="indented">They thanked him much for that.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;A loaf of bread,&rdquo; the Walrus said,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;Is what we chiefly need:</p>
<p>Pepper and vinegar besides</p>
<p class="indented">Are very good indeed&mdash;</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re ready Oysters dear,</p>
<p class="indented">We can begin to feed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;But not on us!&rdquo; the Oysters cried,</p>
<p class="indented">Turning a little blue,</p>
<p>&ldquo;After such kindness, that would be</p>
<p class="indented">A dismal thing to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night is fine,&rdquo; the Walrus said</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;Do you admire the view?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;It was so kind of you to come!</p>
<p class="indented">And you are very nice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carpenter said nothing but</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;Cut us another slice:</p>
<p>I wish you were not quite so deaf&mdash;</p>
<p class="indented">I&#8217;ve had to ask you twice!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;It seems a shame,&rdquo; the Walrus said,</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;To play them such a trick,</p>
<p>After we&#8217;ve brought them out so far,</p>
<p class="indented">And made them trot so quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carpenter said nothing but</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;The butter&#8217;s spread too thick!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;I weep for you,&rdquo; the Walrus said.</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;I deeply sympathize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With sobs and tears he sorted out</p>
<p class="indented">Those of the largest size.</p>
<p>Holding his pocket handkerchief</p>
<p class="indented">Before his streaming eyes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="illustration" id="ill22">
<img src="images/Illustration-22.jpg" alt="With sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size" />
</div>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;O Oysters,&rdquo; said the Carpenter.</p>
<p class="indented">&ldquo;You&#8217;ve had a pleasant run!</p>
<p>Shall we be trotting home again?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indented">But answer came there none&mdash;</p>
<p>And that was scarcely odd, because</p>
<p class="indented">They&#8217;d eaten every one.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I like the Walrus best,&rsquo; said Alice: &lsquo;because you see he
was a <em>little</em> sorry for the poor oysters.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He ate more than the Carpenter, though,&rsquo; said Tweedledee.
&lsquo;You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter
couldn&#8217;t count how many he took: contrariwise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was mean!&rsquo; Alice said indignantly. &lsquo;Then I like the
Carpenter best &ndash; if he didn&#8217;t eat so many as the Walrus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he ate as many as he could get,&rsquo; said Tweedledum.</p>

<p>This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, &lsquo;Well! They were
<em>both</em> very unpleasant characters&mdash;&rsquo; Here she checked herself
in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a
large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. &lsquo;Are there any lions or tigers about here?&rsquo; she
asked timidly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s only the Red King snoring,&rsquo; said Tweedledee.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and look at him!&rsquo; the brothers cried, and they each took
one of Alice&#8217;s hands, and led her up to where the King was sleeping.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Isn&#8217;t he a <em>lovely</em> sight?&rsquo; said Tweedledum.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill23">
<img src="images/Illustration-23.jpg" alt="The King had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel" />
</div>

<p>Alice couldn&#8217;t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap
on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and
snoring loud &ndash; &lsquo;fit to snore his head off!&rsquo; as Tweedledum
remarked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll catch cold with lying on the damp
grass,&rsquo; said Alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s dreaming now,&rsquo; said Tweedledee: &lsquo;and what do
you think he&#8217;s dreaming about?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice said &lsquo;Nobody can guess that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, about <em>you</em>!&rsquo; Tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his
hands triumphantly. &lsquo;And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you
suppose you&#8217;d be?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where I am now, of course,&rsquo; said Alice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not you!&rsquo; Tweedledee retorted contemptuously. &lsquo;You&#8217;d
be nowhere. Why, you&#8217;re only a sort of thing in his dream!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If that there King was to wake,&rsquo; added Tweedledum,
&lsquo;you&#8217;d go out &ndash; bang! &ndash; just like a candle!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&#8217;t!&rsquo; Alice exclaimed indignantly. &lsquo;Besides,
if <em>I&#8217;m</em> only a sort of thing in his dream, what are <em>you</em>,
I should like to know?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ditto&rsquo; said Tweedledum.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ditto, ditto&rsquo; cried Tweedledee.</p>

<p>He shouted this so loud that Alice couldn&#8217;t help saying, &lsquo;Hush!
You&#8217;ll be waking him, I&#8217;m afraid, if you make so much
noise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it no use <em>your</em> talking about waking him,&rsquo; said
Tweedledum, &lsquo;when you&#8217;re only one of the things in his dream. You
know very well you&#8217;re not real.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I <em>am</em> real!&rsquo; said Alice and began to cry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You wo&#8217;n&#8217;t make yourself a bit realler by crying,&rsquo;
Tweedledee remarked: &lsquo;there&#8217;s nothing to cry about.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I wasn&#8217;t real,&rsquo; Alice said &ndash; half-laughing
through her tears, it all seemed so ridiculous &ndash; &lsquo;I shouldn&#8217;t
be able to cry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope you don&#8217;t suppose those are <em>real</em> tears?&rsquo;
Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know they&#8217;re talking nonsense,&rsquo; Alice thought to
herself: &lsquo;and it&#8217;s foolish to cry about it.&rsquo; So she brushed
away her tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. &lsquo;At any rate
I&#8217;d better be getting out of the wood, for really it&#8217;s coming on
very dark. Do you think it&#8217;s going to rain?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and looked
up into it. &lsquo;No, I don&#8217;t think it is,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;at
least &ndash; not under <em>here</em>. Nohow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it may rain <em>outside</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It may &ndash; if it chooses,&rsquo; said Tweedledee:
&lsquo;we&#8217;ve no objection. Contrariwise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Selfish things!&rsquo; thought Alice, and she was just going to say
&lsquo;Good-night&rsquo; and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under
the umbrella and seized her by the wrist.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you see <em>that</em>?&rsquo; he said, in a voice choking with
passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with
a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s only a rattle,&rsquo; Alice said, after a careful
examination of the little white thing. &lsquo;Not a rattle-<em>snake</em>, you
know,&rsquo; she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: &lsquo;only an
old rattle &ndash; quite old and broken.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I knew it was!&rsquo; cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about
wildly and tear his hair. &lsquo;It&#8217;s spoilt, of course!&rsquo; Here he
looked at Tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide
himself under the umbrella.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill24">
<img src="images/Illustration-24.jpg" alt="Tweedledum began to stamp about wildly and tear his hair" />
</div>

<p>Alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, &lsquo;You
needn&#8217;t be so angry about an old rattle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it isn&#8217;t old!&rsquo; Tweedledum cried, in a greater fury
than ever. &lsquo;It&#8217;s new, I tell you &ndash; I bought it yesterday
&ndash; my nice <span class="caps">new</span> RATTLE!&rsquo; and his voice rose
to a perfect scream.</p>

<p>All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with
himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took
off Alice&#8217;s attention from the angry brother. But he couldn&#8217;t quite
succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only
his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his large
eyes &ndash; &lsquo;looking more like a fish than anything else,&rsquo; Alice
thought.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you agree to have a battle?&rsquo; Tweedledum said in a
calmer tone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of
the umbrella: &lsquo;only <em>she</em> must help us to dress up, you
know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a
minute with their arms full of things &ndash; such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. &lsquo;I hope
you&#8217;re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?&rsquo; Tweedledum
remarked. &lsquo;Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or
other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in
all her life &ndash; the way those two bustled about &ndash; and the quantity of
things they put on &ndash; and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons &ndash; &lsquo;Really they&#8217;ll be more like bundles of
old clothes than anything else, by the time they&#8217;re ready!&rsquo; she said
to herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, &lsquo;to
keep his head from being cut off,&rsquo; as he said.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill25">
<img src="images/Illustration-25.jpg" alt="&lsquo;Really they&#8217;ll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else!&rsquo;" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; he added very gravely, &lsquo;it&#8217;s one of the
most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle &ndash; to get
one&#8217;s head cut off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of
hurting his feelings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do I look very pale?&rsquo; said Tweedledum, coming up to have his
helmet tied on. (He <em>called</em> it a helmet, though it certainly looked much
more like a saucepan.)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well &ndash; yes &ndash; a <em>little</em>,&rsquo; Alice replied
gently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m very brave generally,&rsquo; he went on in a low voice:
&lsquo;only to-day I happen to have a headache.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And <em>I&#8217;ve</em> got a toothache!&rsquo; said Tweedledee, who
had overheard the remark. &lsquo;I&#8217;m far worse off than you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you&#8217;d better not fight to-day,&rsquo; said Alice, thinking
it a good opportunity to make peace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We <em>must</em> have a bit of a fight, but I don&#8217;t care about
going on long,&rsquo; said Tweedledum. &lsquo;What&#8217;s the time
now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tweedledee looked at his watch, and said &lsquo;Half-past four.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let&#8217;s fight till six, and then have dinner,&rsquo; said
Tweedledum.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; the other said, rather sadly: &lsquo;and
<em>she</em> can watch us &ndash; only you&#8217;d better not come <em>very</em>
close,&rsquo; he added: &lsquo;I generally hit everything I can see &ndash; when
I get really excited.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And <em>I</em> hit everything within reach,&rsquo; cried Tweedledum,
&lsquo;whether I can see it or not!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice laughed. &lsquo;You must hit the <em>trees</em> pretty often, I should
think,&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. &lsquo;I don&#8217;t
suppose,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there&#8217;ll be a tree left standing, for ever
so far round, by the time we&#8217;ve finished!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And all about a rattle!&rsquo; said Alice, still hoping to make them a
<em>little</em> ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&#8217;t have minded it so much,&rsquo; said Tweedledum,
&lsquo;if it hadn&#8217;t been a new one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish the monstrous crow would come!&rsquo; thought Alice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s only one sword, you know,&rsquo; Tweedledum said to his
brother: &lsquo;but <em>you</em> can have the umbrella &ndash; it&#8217;s quite
as sharp. Only we must begin quick. It&#8217;s getting as dark as it
can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And darker,&rsquo; said Tweedledee.</p>

<p>It was getting dark so suddenly that Alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. &lsquo;What a thick black cloud that is!&rsquo; she
said. &lsquo;And how fast it comes! Why, I do believe it&#8217;s got
wings!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s the crow!&rsquo; Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of
alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a
moment.</p>

<p>Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
&lsquo;It can never get at me <em>here</em>,&rsquo; she thought:
&lsquo;it&#8217;s far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish
it wouldn&#8217;t flap its wings so &ndash; it makes quite a hurricane in the
wood &ndash; here&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s shawl being blown away!&rsquo;</p>
