<h1>The Garden of Live Flowers</h1>

<p class="initial"><span class="drop"><span
class="predrop">&lsquo;</span>I</span><span class="first">&#32;should</span> see
the garden far better,&rsquo; said Alice to herself, &lsquo;if I could get to
the top of that hill: and here&#8217;s a path that leads straight to it &ndash;
at least, no, it doesn&#8217;t do <em>that</em>&mdash;&rsquo; (after going a few
yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), &lsquo;but I suppose
it will at last. But how curiously it twists! It&#8217;s more like a corkscrew
than a path! Well, <em>this</em> turn goes to the hill, I suppose &ndash; no, it
doesn&#8217;t! This goes straight back to the house! Well then, I&#8217;ll try
it the other way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always
coming back to the house, do what she would. Indeed, once, when she turned a
corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop
herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s no use talking about it,&rsquo; Alice said, looking up at
the house and pretending it was arguing with her. &lsquo;I&#8217;m <em>not</em>
going in again yet. I know I should have to get through the Looking-glass again
&ndash; back into the old room &ndash; and there&#8217;d be an end of all my
adventures!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down
the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. For a few
minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, &lsquo;I really
<em>shall</em> do it this time&mdash;&rsquo; when the path gave a sudden twist
and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, it&#8217;s too bad!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I never saw such a
house for getting in the way! Never!&rsquo;</p>

<p>However, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done
but start again. This time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of
daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Tiger-lily,&rsquo; said Alice, addressing herself to one that was
waving gracefully about in the wind, &lsquo;I <em>wish</em> you could
talk!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We <em>can</em> talk,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily: &lsquo;when
there&#8217;s anybody worth talking to.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill10">
<img src="images/Illustration-10.jpg" alt="&lsquo;We can talk,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily" />
</div>

<p>Alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. At length, as the Tiger-lily only went on waving
about, she spoke again, in a timid voice &ndash; almost in a whisper. &lsquo;And
can <em>all</em> the flowers talk?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;As well as <em>you</em> can,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily. &lsquo;And a
great deal louder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It isn&#8217;t manners for us to begin, you know,&rsquo; said the
Rose, &lsquo;and I really was wondering when you&#8217;d speak! Said I to
myself, &ldquo;Her face has got <em>some</em> sense in it, though it&#8217;s not
a clever one!&rdquo; Still, you&#8217;re the right colour, and that goes a long
way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t care about the colour,&rsquo; the Tiger-lily remarked.
&lsquo;If only her petals curled up a little more, she&#8217;d be all
right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice didn&#8217;t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
&lsquo;Aren&#8217;t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with
nobody to take care of you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s the tree in the middle,&rsquo; said the Rose:
&lsquo;what else is it good for?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But what could it do, if any danger came?&rsquo; Alice asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It says &ldquo;Bough-wough!&rdquo;&rsquo; cried a Daisy:
&lsquo;that&#8217;s why its branches are called boughs!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Didn&#8217;t you know <em>that</em>?&rsquo; cried another Daisy, and
here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little
shrill voices. &lsquo;Silence, every one of you!&rsquo; cried the Tiger-lily,
waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement.
&lsquo;They know I ca&#8217;n&#8217;t get at them!&rsquo; it panted, bending its
quivering head towards Alice, &lsquo;or they wouldn&#8217;t dare to do
it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to
the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, &lsquo;If you
don&#8217;t hold your tongues, I&#8217;ll pick you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s right!&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily. &lsquo;The daisies are
worst of all. When one speaks, they all begin together, and it&#8217;s enough to
make one wither to hear the way they go on!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How is it you can all talk so nicely?&rsquo; Alice said, hoping to get
it into a better temper by a compliment. &lsquo;I&#8217;ve been in many gardens
before, but none of the flowers could talk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Put your hand down, and feel the ground,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily.
&lsquo;Then you&#8217;ll know why.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice did so. &lsquo;It&#8217;s very hard,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but I
don&#8217;t see what that has to do with it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In most gardens,&rsquo; the Tiger-lily said, &lsquo;they make the beds
too soft &ndash; so that the flowers are always asleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This sounded a very good reason, and Alice was quite pleased to know it.
&lsquo;I never thought of that before!&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s <em>my</em> opinion that you never think <em>at
all</em>,&rsquo; the Rose said in a rather severe tone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never saw anybody that looked stupider,&rsquo; a Violet said, so
suddenly, that Alice quite jumped; for it hadn&#8217;t spoken before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hold <em>your</em> tongue!&rsquo; cried the Tiger-lily. &lsquo;As if
<em>you</em> ever saw anybody! You keep your head under the leaves, and snore
away there, till you know no more what&#8217;s going on in the world, than if
you were a bud!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are there any more people in the garden besides me?&rsquo; Alice said,
not choosing to notice the Rose&#8217;s last remark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s one other flower in the garden that can move about like
you,&rsquo; said the Rose. &lsquo;I wonder how you do it&mdash;&rsquo;
(&lsquo;You&#8217;re always wondering,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily), &lsquo;but
she&#8217;s more bushy than you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is she like me?&rsquo; Alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed
her mind, &lsquo;There&#8217;s another little girl in the garden,
somewhere!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, she has the same awkward shape as you,&rsquo; the Rose said,
&lsquo;but she&#8217;s redder &ndash; and her petals are shorter, I
think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,&rsquo; the
Tiger-lily interrupted: &lsquo;not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But that&#8217;s not <em>your</em> fault,&rsquo; the Rose added
kindly: &lsquo;you&#8217;re beginning to fade, you know &ndash; and then one
ca&#8217;n&#8217;t help one&#8217;s petals getting a little untidy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice didn&#8217;t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she
asked &lsquo;Does she ever come out here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I daresay you&#8217;ll see her soon,&rsquo; said the Rose.
&lsquo;She&#8217;s one of the thorny kind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where does she wear the thorns?&rsquo; Alice asked with some
curiosity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why all round her head, of course,&rsquo; the Rose replied. &lsquo;I
was wondering <em>you</em> hadn&#8217;t got some too. I thought it was the
regular rule.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She&#8217;s coming!&rsquo; cried the Larkspur. &lsquo;I hear her
footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the Red Queen.
&lsquo;She&#8217;s grown a good deal!&rsquo; was her first remark. She had
indeed: when Alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches
high &ndash; and here she was, half a head taller than Alice herself!</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s the fresh air that does it,&rsquo; said the Rose:
&lsquo;wonderfully fine air it is, out here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think I&#8217;ll go and meet her,&rsquo; said Alice, for, though the
flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a
talk with a real Queen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You ca&#8217;n&#8217;t possibly do that,&rsquo; said the Rose:
&lsquo;<em>I</em> should advise you to walk the other way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once
towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and
found herself walking in at the front-door again.</p>

<p>A little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen
(whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the
plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.</p>

<p id="mov-1w">It succeeded beautifully. She had not been walking a minute
before she found herself face to face with the Red Queen, and full in sight of
the hill she had been so long aiming at.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where do you come from?&rsquo; said the Red Queen. &lsquo;And where
are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don&#8217;t twiddle your fingers all
the time.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill11">
<img src="images/Illustration-11.jpg" alt="She found herself face to face with the Red Queen" />
</div>

<p>Alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could,
that she had lost her way.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by <em>your</em> way,&rsquo; said the
Queen: &lsquo;all the ways about here belong to <em>me</em> &ndash; but why did
you come out here at all?&rsquo; she added in a kinder tone. &lsquo;Curtsey
while you&#8217;re thinking what to say, it saves time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the Queen to
disbelieve it. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll try it when I go home,&rsquo; she thought to
herself, &lsquo;the next time I&#8217;m a little late for dinner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s time for you to answer now,&rsquo; the Queen said, looking
at her watch: &lsquo;open your mouth a <em>little</em> wider when you speak, and
always say &ldquo;your Majesty.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your
Majesty&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s right,&rsquo; said the Queen, patting her on the head,
which Alice didn&#8217;t like at all, &lsquo;though, when you say
&ldquo;garden,&rdquo; &ndash; <em>I&#8217;ve</em> seen gardens, compared with
which this would be a wilderness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice didn&#8217;t dare to argue the point, but went on: &lsquo;&mdash;and I
thought I&#8217;d try and find my way to the top of that hill&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When you say &ldquo;hill,&rdquo;&rsquo; the Queen interrupted,
&lsquo;<em>I</em> could show you hills, in comparison with which you&#8217;d
call that a valley.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I shouldn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Alice, surprised into contradicting
her at last: &lsquo;a hill <em>ca&#8217;n&#8217;t</em> be a valley, you know.
That would be nonsense&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Red Queen shook her head, &lsquo;You may call it &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;
if you like,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but <em>I&#8217;ve</em> heard nonsense,
compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the Queen&#8217;s tone that she
was a <em>little</em> offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.</p>

<p>For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions
over the country &ndash; and a most curious country it was. There were a number
of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the
ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges,
that reached from brook to brook.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill12">
<img src="images/Illustration-12.jpg" alt="The ground between was divided up into squares" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I declare it&#8217;s marked out just like a large chessboard!&rsquo;
Alice said at last. &lsquo;There ought to be some men moving about somewhere
&ndash; and so there are!&rsquo; She added in a tone of delight, and her heart
began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. &lsquo;It&#8217;s a great
huge game of chess that&#8217;s being played &ndash; all over the world &ndash;
if this <em>is</em> the world at all, you know. Oh, what fun it is! How I
<em>wish</em> I was one of them! I wouldn&#8217;t mind being a Pawn, if only I
might join &ndash; though of course I should <em>like</em> to be a Queen,
best.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She glanced rather shyly at the real Queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, &lsquo;That&#8217;s easily managed.
You can be the White Queen&#8217;s Pawn, if you like, as Lily&#8217;s too young
to play; and you&#8217;re in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to
the Eighth Square you&#8217;ll be a Queen&mdash;&rsquo; Just at this moment,
somehow or other, they began to run.</p>

<p>Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was
that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and
the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and
still the Queen kept crying &lsquo;Faster! Faster!&rsquo; but Alice felt she
<em>could not</em> go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.</p>

<p>The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things
round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never
seemed to pass anything. &lsquo;I wonder if all the things move along with
us?&rsquo; thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her
thoughts, for she cried, &lsquo;Faster! Don&#8217;t try to talk!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Not that Alice had any idea of doing <em>that</em>. She felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still
the Queen cried &lsquo;Faster! Faster!&rsquo; and dragged her along. &lsquo;Are
we nearly there?&rsquo; Alice managed to pant out at last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nearly there!&rsquo; the Queen repeated. &lsquo;Why, we passed it ten
minutes ago! Faster!&rsquo; And they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind
whistling in Alice&#8217;s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she
fancied.</p>

<p id="mov-1r">&lsquo;Now! Now!&rsquo; cried the Queen. &lsquo;Faster!
Faster!&rsquo; And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through
the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as
Alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting
on the ground, breathless and giddy.</p>

<div class="illustration" id="ill13">
<img src="images/Illustration-13.jpg" alt="And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air" />
</div>

<p>The Queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, &lsquo;You may rest
a little now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice looked round her in great surprise. &lsquo;Why, I do believe
we&#8217;ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything&#8217;s just as it
was!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course it is,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;what would you have
it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, in <em>our</em> country,&rsquo; said Alice, still panting a
little, &lsquo;you&#8217;d generally get to somewhere else &ndash; if you ran
very fast for a long time, as we&#8217;ve been doing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A slow sort of country!&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;Now,
<em>here</em>, you see, it takes all the running <em>you</em> can do, to keep in
the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice
as fast as that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;d rather not try, please!&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;I&#8217;m
quite content to stay here &ndash; only I <em>am</em> so hot and
thirsty!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know what <em>you&#8217;d</em> like!&rsquo; the Queen said
good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. &lsquo;Have a
biscuit?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alice thought it would not be civil to say &lsquo;No,&rsquo; though it
wasn&#8217;t at all what she wanted. So she took it, and ate it as well as she
could: and it was <em>very</em> dry; and she thought she had never been so
nearly choked in all her life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;While you&#8217;re refreshing yourself,&rsquo; said the Queen,
&lsquo;I&#8217;ll just take the measurements.&rsquo; And she took a ribbon out
of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking
little pegs in here and there.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At the end of two yards,&rsquo; she said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, &lsquo;I shall give you your directions &ndash; have another
biscuit?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said Alice: &lsquo;one&#8217;s <em>quite</em>
enough!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thirst quenched, I hope?&rsquo; said the Queen.</p>

<p>Alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the Queen did not wait
for an answer, but went on. &lsquo;At the end of <em>three</em> yards I shall
repeat them &ndash; for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of
<em>four</em>, I shall say good-bye. And at the end of <em>five</em>, I shall
go!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had got all the pegs put in by this time, and Alice looked on with great
interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the
row.</p>

<p>At the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, &lsquo;A pawn goes two squares
in its first move, you know. So you&#8217;ll go very quickly through the Third
Square &ndash; by railway, I should think &ndash; and you&#8217;ll find yourself
in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, <em>that</em> square belongs to
Tweedledum and Tweedledee &ndash; the Fifth is mostly water &ndash; the Sixth
belongs to Humpty Dumpty &ndash; But you make no remark?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I &ndash; I didn&#8217;t know I had to make one &ndash; just
then,&rsquo; Alice faltered out.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>should</em> have said, &ldquo;It&#8217;s extremely kind of you
to tell me all this&rdquo; &ndash; however, we&#8217;ll suppose it said &ndash;
the Seventh Square is all forest &ndash; however, one of the Knights will show
you the way &ndash; and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and
it&#8217;s all feasting and fun!&rsquo; Alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down
again.</p>

<p>At the next peg the Queen turned again, and this time she said, &lsquo;Speak
in French when you ca&#8217;n&#8217;t think of the English for a thing &ndash;
turn out your toes as you walk &ndash; and remember who you are!&rsquo; She did
not wait for Alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg,
where she turned for a moment to say &lsquo;good-bye,&rsquo; and then hurried on
to the last.</p>

<p>How it happened, Alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg,
she was gone. Whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into
the wood (&lsquo;and she <em>can</em> run very fast!&rsquo; thought Alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and Alice began to remember that
she was a Pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move.</p>
