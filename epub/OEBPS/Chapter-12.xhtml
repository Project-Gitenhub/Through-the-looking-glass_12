<h1>Which Dreamed It?</h1>

<p class="initial"><span class="drop"><span
class="predrop">&lsquo;</span>Y</span><span class="first">our</span> majesty
shouldn&#8217;t purr so loud,&rsquo; Alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. &lsquo;You woke me
out of oh! such a nice dream! And you&#8217;ve been along with me, Kitty &ndash;
all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made the remark)
that, whatever you say to them, they <em>always</em> purr. &lsquo;If they would
only purr for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and mew for &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or any rule of
that sort,&rsquo; she had said, &lsquo;so that one could keep up a conversation!
But how <em>can</em> you talk with a person if they <em>always</em> say the same
thing?&rsquo;</p>

<p>On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no.&rsquo;</p>

<p id="mov-11w">So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had
found the Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. &lsquo;Now, Kitty!&rsquo; she
cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. &lsquo;Confess that was what you turned
into!&rsquo;</p>

<p>(&lsquo;But it wouldn&#8217;t look at it,&rsquo; she said, when she was
explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: &lsquo;it turned away its head,
and pretended not to see it: but it looked a <em>little</em> ashamed of itself,
so I think it <em>must</em> have been the Red Queen.&rsquo;)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!&rsquo; Alice cried with a merry
laugh. &lsquo;And curtsey while you&#8217;re thinking what to &ndash; what to
purr. It saves time, remember!&rsquo; And she caught it up and gave it one
little kiss, &lsquo;just in honour of having been a Red Queen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Snowdrop, my pet!&rsquo; she went on, looking over her shoulder at the
White Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, &lsquo;when
<em>will</em> Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must
be the reason you were so untidy in my dream &ndash; Dinah! do you know that
you&#8217;re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it&#8217;s most disrespectful of
you!</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what did <em>Dinah</em> turn to, I wonder?&rsquo; she prattled on,
as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her
hand, to watch the kittens. &lsquo;Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty
Dumpty? I <em>think</em> you did &ndash; however, you&#8217;d better not mention
it to your friends just yet, for I&#8217;m not sure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;By the way, Kitty, if only you&#8217;d been really with me in my
dream, there was one thing you <em>would</em> have enjoyed &ndash; I had such a
quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall
have a real treat. All the time you&#8217;re eating your breakfast, I&#8217;ll
repeat &ldquo;The Walrus and the Carpenter&rdquo; to you; and then you can make
believe it&#8217;s oysters, dear!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, Kitty, let&#8217;s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This
is a serious question, my dear, and you should <em>not</em> go on licking your
paw like that &ndash; as if Dinah hadn&#8217;t washed you this morning! You see,
Kitty, it <em>must</em> have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my
dream, of course &ndash; but then I was part of his dream, too! <em>Was</em> it
the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know &ndash;
Oh, Kitty, do help to settle it! I&#8217;m sure your paw can wait!&rsquo; But
the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn&#8217;t
heard the question.</p>

<p>Which do <em>you</em> think it was?</p>
