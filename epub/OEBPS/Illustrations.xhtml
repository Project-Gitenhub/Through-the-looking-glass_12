<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill2">The kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill3">She scrambled back into the arm-chair</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill4">And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill5">In another moment Alice was through the glass</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill6">&lsquo;Here are the Red King and the Red Queen&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill7">So Alice picked the King up very gently</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill8">&lsquo;The White Knight is sliding down the poker&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-01.xhtml#ill9">The Jabberwock</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill10">&lsquo;We can talk,&rsquo; said the Tiger-lily</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill11">She found herself face to face with the Red Queen</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill12">The ground between was divided up into squares</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-02.xhtml#ill13">And they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill14">&lsquo;You&#8217;re travelling the wrong way&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill15">The Rocking-horse-fly</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill16">The Snap-dragon-fly</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill17">The Bread-and-butter-fly</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-03.xhtml#ill18">Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill19">They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other&#8217;s neck</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill20">The Walrus and the Carpenter were walking close at hand</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill21">And all the little Oysters stood and waited in a row</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill22">With sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill23">The King had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill24">Tweedledum began to stamp about wildly and tear his hair</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-04.xhtml#ill25">&lsquo;Really they&#8217;ll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else!&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill26">She helped her to put on her shawl again</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill27">the King&#8217;s Messenger is in prison now</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill28">Was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter?</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-05.xhtml#ill29">The boat glided gently on</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill30">He leant forwards and offered Alice his hand</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill31">Toves, borogroves and raths in the wabe</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-06.xhtml#ill32">&lsquo;I went and shouted in his ear&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-07.xhtml#ill33">The confusion got worse every moment</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-07.xhtml#ill34">The Messenger handed a sandwich to the King</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-07.xhtml#ill35">Hatta only munched away, and drank some more tea</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-07.xhtml#ill36">&lsquo;It&#8217;s a fabulous monster!&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-07.xhtml#ill37">But before Alice could answer him, the drums began</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill38">They hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and Judy</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill39">Whenever the horse stopped, he fell off in front</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill1">They went on a little way in silence after this</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill40">She could see nothing but the soles of his feet</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill41">I saw an aged aged man, a-sitting on a gate</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-08.xhtml#ill42">It was a golden crown</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill43">She found the Red Queen and the White Queen sitting close to her</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill44">In another moment both Queens were fast asleep</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill45">A very old Frog got up and hobbled slowly towards her</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill46">The leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to Alice</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill47">And then all sorts of things happened in a moment</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-09.xhtml#ill48">&lsquo;I&#8217;ll shake you into a kitten!&rsquo;</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-11.xhtml#ill49">And it really was a kitten</a><br/>
<a href="Chapter-12.xhtml#ill50">So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the Red Queen</a><br/>
